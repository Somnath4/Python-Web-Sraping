# Web-Srapping
This web scraping project was focused on collecting data on global box office collections from the website [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/?ref_=bo_nb_cso_tab). The project involved scraping data from the website for each year from 2010 to 2022, and then merging the collected data into a single data set.
